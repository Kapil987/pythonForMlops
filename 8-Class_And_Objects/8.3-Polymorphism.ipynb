    "#### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces"

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of a method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, you can create more extensible and maintainable object-oriented programs."
