    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a general idea of a \"Vehicle\" â€“ it's something you can drive. That's what the `Vehicle` class represents. The `ABC` and `@abstractmethod` parts mean that `Vehicle` is a blueprint, and every specific type of vehicle *must* have a way to \"start its engine.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you have a specific type of `Vehicle` called a `Car`. It follows the rules of the `Vehicle` blueprint and provides its own specific way to `start_engine` (which is just printing \"Car engine started\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `operate_vehicle` function is like a general instruction. It can take *any* type of `Vehicle` and tell it to first `start_engine` and then `drive`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last part, you create a `Car` and then use the `operate_vehicle` function with it. So, the car starts its engine and then the general message about driving is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: You have a general \"Vehicle\" idea with a mandatory \"start engine\" action. A \"Car\" is a specific type of vehicle that knows how to start its engine. You can then operate any vehicle (like your car) by telling it to start and drive."
