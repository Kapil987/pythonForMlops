### if tracking_url_type_store != 'file': in what condtion it will be file the uri will alway be http or https right ?

Yes, for many common MLflow setups, especially when you're connecting to a server, the URI scheme will be `http` or `https`.

However, the `tracking_url_type_store` *will* be `'file'` under these specific conditions:

1.  **Default MLflow Behavior (No `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` call):**
    If you **do not** call `mlflow.set_tracking_uri()` at all, MLflow defaults to using a local file system. It creates an `mlruns` directory in your current working directory and logs everything there. In this default scenario, `mlflow.get_tracking_uri()` would return a path like `file:///path/to/your/project/mlruns/`, and `urlparse(...).scheme` would correctly extract `'file'`.

    *Example:*
    ```python
    import mlflow
    # No mlflow.set_tracking_uri() is called

    # ... your model training code ...

    with mlflow.start_run():
        # ... log params, metrics ...
        tracking_url_type_store = urlparse(mlflow.get_tracking_uri()).scheme
        print(f"Tracking URI scheme: {tracking_url_type_store}") # This will likely print 'file'
        if tracking_url_type_store != 'file':
            # This block won't run
            pass
        else:
            # This block WILL run
            mlflow.sklearn.log_model(best_model,"model",signature=signature)
    ```

2.  **Explicitly Setting a Local File Path:**
    If you explicitly set the tracking URI to a local file path using the `file://` scheme:

    *Example:*
    ```python
    import mlflow
    from urllib.parse import urlparse

    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("file:///C:/my_mlflow_logs") # For Windows
    # Or for Linux/macOS: mlflow.set_tracking_uri("file:///home/user/my_mlflow_logs")

    # ... your model training code ...

    with mlflow.start_run():
        # ... log params, metrics ...
        tracking_url_type_store = urlparse(mlflow.get_tracking_uri()).scheme
        print(f"Tracking URI scheme: {tracking_url_type_store}") # This will print 'file'
        if tracking_url_type_store != 'file':
            # This block won't run
            pass
        else:
            # This block WILL run
            mlflow.sklearn.log_model(best_model,"model",signature=signature)
    ```

**In summary:**

The condition `if tracking_url_type_store != 'file':` is used to differentiate between:

* **Remote/Server-based tracking** (e.g., `http://`, `https://`, `databricks://`), which typically supports the MLflow Model Registry.
* **Local file-based tracking** (e.g., `file://` or the default behavior when no URI is set), which stores everything directly in your file system and does not directly integrate with a central Model Registry.
